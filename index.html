                <p>
                  Kilmainham Gaol Museum in Dublin is a historic prison turned
                  museum that offers a poignant glimpse into Ireland’s fight for
                  independence. Once home to political prisoners and
                  revolutionaries, the jail's preserved cells and exhibits now
                  tell the powerful stories of those who shaped Irish history,
                  making it a must-visit for anyone interested in Ireland's
                  journey to freedom.

                <h4>Saint Patrick's Cathedral</h4>
                <p>
                  A magnificent cathedral that houses Jonathan Swift's remains
                  (he wrote Gulliver's Travels). It is the only remaining
                  cathedral in Ireland with a daily sung services. A small
                  entrance fee is charged for tourists and all money raised goes
                  back to paying for the upkeep of the building.

                <p>
                  The present Cathedral building, dating from 1220, is a witness
                  to 800 years of Ireland's varied past. The glory of the
                  building, its stained-glass windows and many monuments make it
                  a very popular tourist attraction. The Cathedral family is
                  pleased to welcome hundreds of thousands of visitors each
                  year.

                <p>
                  Kilmainham Gaol Museum in Dublin is a historic prison turned
                  museum that offers a poignant glimpse into Irelandâ€™s fight for
                  independence. Once home to political prisoners and
                  revolutionaries, the jail's preserved cells and exhibits now
                  tell the powerful stories of those who shaped Irish history,
                  making it a must-visit for anyone interested in Ireland's
                  journey to freedom.
